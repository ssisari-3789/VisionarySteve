                Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an
                American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for
                co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the
                founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar.
                He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the
                1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and
                fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

            <h3>The timeline of Steve's life</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>1961</strong> - The Jobs family has moves to Mountain
                View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon

                and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to

                as an internship with the company that summer.

                Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography,

                their four-year age difference.

                in on classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite
                not getting credit for them.

                <strong>1974</strong> - Begins a brief stint as an engineer at

                whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a
                single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to
                become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel
                through India, only to return to California to live in a
                commune.

                introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's
                shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let
                Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says,
                "Never trust a computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the
                first commercially successful small computer with a graphical
                user interface.

                Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying
                in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for
                me to get on with my life. It's obvious that I've got to do
                something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT
                Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling
                $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT
                workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim
                Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide
                Web.

                after the release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice
                of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The film earns $192
                million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite
                attractive for celebrities to lend their voices to animated
                characters.

                CEO title at the Macworld Expo, joking that he would be using

                conventions. Takes a $1 annual salary. Soon terminates projects
                including Newton and OpenDoc, and changes licensing terms to
                make Mac-cloning cost-prohibitive. Technologies developed at
                NeXT ultimately evolve into Apple products such as the Mac OS.
